# Social Network Api 

## Description

I created this back end to a social networking site where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used a MongoDB database and the Mongoose ODM as well as Express.js to create the API routes for this site.

## Installation

Please navigate to the github repo, download all relevant files, and run "npm install" from the command line to install all Node dependencies. 

## Usage

Start the server by running "npm start" from the command line. Optionally, you can use the command "nodemon" to start the server if you have nodemon installed. The front end of this app has not yet been created, but all the api endpoints can be tested using an application like Insomnia. This is demonstrated in the walkthrough video.
